@article{benetos2011joint,
abstract = {In this paper, a method for automatic transcription of music signals based on joint multiple-F0 estimation is proposed. As a time-frequency representation, the constant-Q resonator time-frequency image is employed, while a novel noise suppression technique based on pink noise assumption is applied in a preprocessing step. In the multiple-F0 estimation stage, the optimal tuning and inharmonicity parameters are computed and a salience function is proposed in order to select pitch candidates. For each pitch candidate combination, an overlapping partial treatment procedure is used, which is based on a novel spectral envelope estimation procedure for the log-frequency domain, in order to compute the harmonic envelope of candidate pitches. In order to select the optimal pitch combination for each time frame, a score function is proposed which combines spectral and temporal characteristics of the candidate pitches and also aims to suppress harmonic errors. For postprocessing, hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) trained on MIDI data are employed, in order to boost transcription accuracy. The system was trained on isolated piano sounds from the MAPS database and was tested on classic and jazz recordings from the RWC database, as well as on recordings from a Disklavier piano. A comparison with several state-of-the-art systems is provided using a variety of error metrics, where encouraging results are indicated.},

In this paper, we propose a new mid-level representation based on the decomposition of a signal into a small number of sound atoms or molecules bearing explicit musical instrument labels. Each atom is a sum of windowed harmonic sinusoidal partials whose relative amplitudes are specific to one instrument, and each molecule consists of several atoms from the same instrument spanning successive time windows. We design efficient algorithms to extract the most prominent atoms or molecules and investigate several applications of this representation, including polyphonic instrument recognition and music visualization.},

@article{mao2017lsgan,
abstract = {Unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has proven hugely successful. Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator. We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson $\chi^2$ divergence. There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process. We evaluate LSGANs on five scene datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs. We also conduct two comparison experiments between LSGANs and regular GANs to illustrate the stability of LSGANs.},

abstract = {Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis is a novel statistical technique for the analysis of two-mode and co-occurrence data, which has applications in information retrieval and filtering, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. Compared to standard Latent Semantic Analysis which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed method is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model. This results in a more principled approach which has a solid foundation in statistics. In order to avoid overfitting, we propose a widely applicable generalization of maximum likelihood model fitting by tempered EM. Our approach yields substantial and consistent improvements over Latent Semantic Analysis in a number of experiments.},

abstract = {Deep clustering is a recently introduced deep learning architecture that uses discriminatively trained embeddings as the basis for clustering. It was recently applied to spectrogram segmentation, resulting in impressive results on speaker-independent multi-speaker separation. In this paper we extend the baseline system with an end-to-end signal approximation objective that greatly improves performance on a challenging speech separation. We first significantly improve upon the baseline system performance by incorporating better regularization, larger temporal context, and a deeper architecture, culminating in an overall improvement in signal to distortion ratio (SDR) of 10.3 dB compared to the baseline of 6.0 dB for two-speaker separation, as well as a 7.1 dB SDR improvement for three-speaker separation. We then extend the model to incorporate an enhancement layer to refine the signal estimates, and perform end-to-end training through both the clustering and enhancement stages to maximize signal fidelity. We evaluate the results using automatic speech recognition. The new signal approximation objective, combined with end-to-end training, produces unprecedented performance, reducing the word error rate (WER) from 89.1% down to 30.8%. This represents a major advancement towards solving the cocktail party problem.},

abstract = {Generative models aim to understand the properties of data, through the construction of latent spaces that allow classification and generation. However, as the learning is unsupervised, the latent dimensions are not related to perceptual properties. In parallel, music perception research has aimed to understand timbre based on human dissimilarity ratings. These lead to timbre spaces which exhibit perceptual similarities between sounds. However, they do not generalize to novel examples and do not provide an invertible mapping, preventing audio synthesis. Here, we show that Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can bridge these lines of research and alleviate their weaknesses by regularizing the latent spaces to match perceptual distances collected from timbre studies. Hence, we propose three types of regularization and show that they lead to spaces that are simultaneously coherent with signal properties and perceptual similarities. We show that these spaces can be used for efficient audio classification. We study how audio descriptors are organized along the latent dimensions and show that even though descriptors behave in a non-linear way across the space, they still exhibit a locally smooth evolution. We also show that, as this space generalizes to novel samples, it can be used to predict perceptual similarities of novel instruments. Finally, we exhibit the generative capabilities of our spaces, that can directly synthesize sounds with continuous evolution of timbre perception.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new method for multiple fundamental frequency estimation for speech and music signals is proposed. Applications of audio and speech processing include many well-reviewed algorithms for estimating the fundamental frequency of monophonic speech and music signals. In the case of polyphonic signals, it is more difficult to successfully estimate each of the fundamental frequencies, as reflected by the dearth of existing methods addressing this problem. In this paper, a new method based on the combination of the maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori probability criteria is derived for fundamental frequencies tracking where each one of the fundamental frequencies is modeled by a first-order Markov process. The dominant signal is modeled as a harmonic source with unknown deterministic amplitudes, while the remaining signals, including other harmonic signals, are modeled as Gaussian interference sources with an unknown covariance matrix. After estimation of the dominant source, it is removed from the signal by projection of the signal into the null subspace spanned by the estimated signal. This procedure is iterated for all the harmonic sources in the data. The algorithm is tested with speech, music, and synthetic signals where in each case, two harmonic sources of the same kind were mixed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared to an existing reference method in terms of gross-error-rate as a function of signal-to-interference ratio},

Audio-based classification of musical instruments thus requires to build signal representations that are invariant to such transformations. This article investigates the construction of learned convolutional architectures for instrument recognition, given a limited amount of annotated training data. In this context, we benchmark three different weight sharing strategies for deep convolutional networks in the time-frequency domain: temporal kernels; time-frequency kernels; and a linear combination of time-frequency kernels which are one octave apart, akin to a Shepard pitch spiral. We provide an acoustical interpretation of these strategies within the source-filter framework of quasi-harmonic sounds with a fixed spectral envelope, which are archetypal of musical notes. The best classification accuracy is obtained by hybridizing all three convolutional layers into a single deep learning architecture.},

Our model predicts pitch onset events and then uses those predictions to condition framewise pitch predictions. During inference, we restrict the predictions from the framewise detector by not allowing a new note to start unless the onset detector also agrees that an onset for that pitch is present in the frame. We focus on improving onsets and offsets together instead of either in isolation as we believe this correlates better with human musical perception. Our approach results in over a 100% relative improvement in note F1 score (with offsets) on the MAPS dataset. Furthermore, we extend the model to predict relative velocities of normalized audio which results in more natural-sounding transcriptions.},

We first compare the performance of several neural network models on the task of recognizing tones from time-frequency representation of a musical signal. We then propose a new partial tracking technique, based on a combination of an auditory model and adaptive oscillator networks. We show how synchronization of adaptive oscillators can be exploited to track partials in a musical signal. We also present an extension of our technique for tracking individual partials to a method for tracking groups of partials by joining adaptive oscillators into networks. We show that oscillator networks improve the accuracy of transcription with neural networks. We also provide a short overview of our entire transcription system and present its performance on transcriptions of several synthesized and real piano recordings. Results show that our approach represents a viable alternative to existing transcription systems.},

We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. DeepBach's strength comes from the use of pseudo-Gibbs sampling coupled with an adapted representation of musical data. This is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which tend to compose music sequentially. Our model is also steerable in the sense that a user can constrain the generation by imposing positional constraints such as notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. We also provide a plugin on top of the MuseScore music editor making the interaction with DeepBach easy to use.},

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2% top-1 and 5.6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6% error on the test set) and 17.3% top-1 error on the validation set.},

@inproceedings{hershey2016deepclustering,
abstract = {We address the problem of acoustic source separation in a deep learning framework we call "deep clustering." Rather than directly estimating signals or masking functions, we train a deep network to produce spectrogram embeddings that are discriminative for partition labels given in training data. Previous deep network approaches provide great advantages in terms of learning power and speed, but previously it has been unclear how to use them to separate signals in a class-independent way. In contrast, spectral clustering approaches are flexible with respect to the classes and number of items to be segmented, but it has been unclear how to leverage the learning power and speed of deep networks. To obtain the best of both worlds, we use an objective function that to train embeddings that yield a low-rank approximation to an ideal pairwise affinity matrix, in a class-independent way. This avoids the high cost of spectral factorization and instead produces compact clusters that are amenable to simple clustering methods. The segmentations are therefore implicitly encoded in the embeddings, and can be "decoded" by clustering. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method can separate speech: when trained on spectrogram features containing mixtures of two speakers, and tested on mixtures of a held-out set of speakers, it can infer masking functions that improve signal quality by around 6dB. We show that the model can generalize to three-speaker mixtures despite training only on two-speaker mixtures. The framework can be used without class labels, and therefore has the potential to be trained on a diverse set of sound types, and to generalize to novel sources. We hope that future work will lead to segmentation of arbitrary sounds, with extensions to microphone array methods as well as image segmentation and other domains.},

@article{yoshii2012nonparametric,
abstract = {The statistical multipitch analyzer described in this paper estimates multiple fundamental frequencies (F0s) in polyphonic music audio signals produced by pitched instruments. It is based on hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian models that can deal with uncertainty of unknown random variables such as model complexities (e.g., the number of F0s and the number of harmonic partials), model parameters (e.g., the values of F0s and the relative weights of harmonic partials), and hyperparameters (i.e., prior knowledge on complexities and parameters). Using these models, we propose a statistical method called infinite latent harmonic allocation (iLHA). To avoid model-complexity control, we allow the observed spectra to contain an unbounded number of sound sources (F0s), each of which is allowed to contain an unbounded number of harmonic partials. More specifically, to model a set of time-sliced spectra, we formulated nested infinite Gaussian mixture models based on hierarchical and generalized Dirichlet processes. To avoid manual tuning of influential hyperparameters, we put noninformative hyperprior distributions on them in a hierarchical manner. For efficient Bayesian inference, we used a modern technique called collapsed variational Bayes.

abstract = {We present a supervised neural network model for polyphonic piano music transcription. The architecture of the proposed model is analogous to speech recognition systems and comprises an acoustic model and a music language model. The acoustic model is a neural network used for estimating the probabilities of pitches in a frame of audio. The language model is a recurrent neural network that models the correlations between pitch combinations over time. The proposed model is general and can be used to transcribe polyphonic music without imposing any constraints on the polyphony. The acoustic and language model predictions are combined using a probabilistic graphical model. Inference over the output variables is performed using the beam search algorithm. We perform two sets of experiments. We investigate various neural network architectures for the acoustic models and also investigate the effect of combining acoustic and music language model predictions using the proposed architecture. We compare performance of the neural network based acoustic models with two popular unsupervised acoustic models. Results show that convolutional neural network acoustic models yields the best performance across all evaluation metrics. We also observe improved performance with the application of the music language models. Finally, we present an efficient variant of beam search that improves performance and reduces run-times by an order of magnitude, making the model suitable for real-time applications.},

abstract = {Automatic music transcription is considered to be one of the hardest problems in music information retrieval, yet recent deep learning approaches have achieved substantial improvements on transcription performance. These approaches commonly employ supervised learning models that predict various time-frequency representations, by minimizing element-wise losses such as the cross entropy function. However, applying the loss in this manner assumes conditional independence of each label given the input, and thus cannot accurately express inter-label dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce an adversarial training scheme that operates directly on the time-frequency representations and makes the output distribution closer to the ground-truth. Through adversarial learning, we achieve a consistent improvement in both frame-level and note-level metrics over Onsets and Frames, a state-of-the-art music transcription model. Our results show that adversarial learning can significantly reduce the error rate while increasing the confidence of the model estimations. Our approach is generic and applicable to any transcription model based on multi-label predictions, which are very common in music signal analysis.},

@article{ganin2015domain,
abstract = {We introduce a new representation learning approach for domain adaptation, in which data at training and test time come from similar but different distributions. Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, and can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning packages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct classification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification), where state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is achieved. We also validate the approach for descriptor learning task in the context of person re-identification application.},

abstract = {Polyphonic pitch transcription consists of estimating the onset time, duration and pitch of each note in a music signal. This task is difficult in general, due to the wide range of possible instruments. This issue has been studied using adaptive models such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which describe the signal as a weighted sum of basis spectra. However basis spectra representing multiple pitches result in inaccurate transcription. To avoid this, we propose a family of constrained NMF models, where each basis spectrum is expressed as a weighted sum of narrowband spectra consisting of a few adjacent partials at harmonic or inharmonic frequencies. The model parameters are adapted via combined multiplicative and Newton updates. The proposed method is shown to outperform standard NMF on a database of piano excerpts.},

abstract = {This paper presents a frame-based system for es- timating multiple fundamental frequencies (F0s) of polyphonic music signals based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) representation. To estimate the number of sources along with their F0s, it is proposed to estimate the noise level beforehand and then jointly evaluate all the possible combinations among pre-selected F0 candidates. Given a set of F0 hypotheses, their hypothetical partial sequences are derived, taking into account where partial overlap may occur. A score function is used to select the plausible sets of F0 hypotheses. To infer the best combination, hypothetical sources are progressively combined and iteratively verified. A hypothetical source is considered valid if it either explains more energy than the noise, or improves significantly the envelope smoothness once the overlapping partials are treated. The proposed system has been submitted to Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) 2007 and 2008 contests where the accuracy has been evaluated with respect to the number of sources inferred and the precision of the F0s estimated. The encouraging results demonstrate its competitive performance among the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Auto-encoding generative adversarial networks (GANs) combine the standard GAN algorithm, which discriminates between real and model-generated data, with a reconstruction loss given by an auto-encoder. Such models aim to prevent mode collapse in the learned generative model by ensuring that it is grounded in all the available training data. In this paper, we develop a principle upon which auto-encoders can be combined with generative adversarial networks by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the generative model. The underlying principle shows that variational inference can be used a basic tool for learning, but with the in- tractable likelihood replaced by a synthetic likelihood, and the unknown posterior distribution replaced by an implicit distribution; both synthetic likelihoods and implicit posterior distributions can be learned using discriminators. This allows us to develop a natural fusion of variational auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks, combining the best of both these methods. We describe a unified objective for optimization, discuss the constraints needed to guide learning, connect to the wide range of existing work, and use a battery of tests to systematically and quantitatively assess the performance of our method.},

abstract = {Monaural singing voice separation is an extremely challenging problem. While efforts in pitch-based inference methods have led to considerable progress in voiced singing voice separation, little attention has been paid to the incapability of such methods to separate unvoiced singing voice due to its in harmonic structure and weaker energy. In this paper, we proposed a systematic approach to identify and separate the unvoiced singing voice from the music accompaniment. We have also enhanced the performance of separating voiced singing via a spectral subtraction method. The proposed system follows the framework of computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) which consists of the segmentation stage and the grouping stage. In the segmentation stage, the input song signals are decomposed into small sensory elements in different time-frequency resolutions. The unvoiced sensory elements are then identified by Gaussian mixture models. The experimental results demonstrated that the quality of the separated singing voice is improved for both the unvoiced and voiced parts. Moreover, to deal with the problem of lack of a publicly available dataset for singing voice separation, we have constructed a corpus called MIR-1K (multimedia information retrieval lab, 1000 song clips) where all singing voices and music accompaniments were recorded separately. Each song clip comes with human-labeled pitch values, unvoiced sounds and vocal/non-vocal segments, and lyrics, as well as the speech recording of the lyrics.},

@article{lee2012exemplar,
abstract = {Pitch, together with other midlevel music features such as rhythm and timbre, holds the promise of bridging the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics for music understanding. This paper investigates the pitch estimation of a piano music signal by exemplar-based sparse representation. A note exemplar is a segment of a piano note, stored in the dictionary. We first describe how to represent a segment of the piano music signal as a linear combination of a small number of note exemplars from a large note exemplar dictionary and then show how the sparse representation problem can be solved by -regularized minimization. The proposed approach incorporates tuning factor estimation, note candidate selection, and hidden-Markov-model-based smoothing into the estimation process to improve accuracy. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed approach does not require retraining for a new piano. Instead, only a dozen notes of the new piano are needed. This feature is computationally attractive and avoids intense manual labeling. The system performance is evaluated using 70 classical music recordings of two real pianos under different recording conditions. The results show that the proposed system outperforms four state-of-the-art systems.},

We propose a class of loss functions, which we call deep perceptual similarity metrics (DeePSiM), that mitigate this problem. Instead of computing distances in the image space, we compute distances between image features extracted by deep neural networks. This metric better reflects perceptually similarity of images and thus leads to better results. We show three applications: autoencoder training, a modification of a variational autoencoder, and inversion of deep convolutional networks. In all cases, the generated images look sharp and resemble natural images.},

CQT refers to a time-frequency represen- tation where the frequency bins are geometrically spaced and the Q-factors (ratios of the center frequencies to band- widths) of all bins are equal. An inverse transform is pro- posed which enables a reasonable-quality (around 55dB signal-to-noise ratio) reconstruction of the original signal from its CQT coefficients. Here CQTs with high Q-factors, equivalent to 12–96 bins per octave, are of particular inter- est. The proposed method is flexible with regard to the number of bins per octave, the applied window function, and the Q-factor, and is particularly suitable for the anal- ysis of music signals. A reference implementation of the proposed methods is published as a Matlab toolbox. The toolbox includes user-interface tools that facilitate spectral data visualization and the indexing and working with the data structure produced by the CQT.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. This paper proposes a note-based music language model (MLM) for improving note-level polyphonic piano transcription. The MLM is based on the recurrent structure, which could model the temporal correlations between notes in music sequences. To combine the outputs of the note-based MLM and acoustic model directly, an integrated architecture is adopted in this paper. We also propose an inference algorithm, in which the note-based MLM is used to predict notes at the blank onsets in the thresholding transcription results. The experimental results show that the proposed inference algorithm improves the performance of note-level transcription. We also observe that the combination of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and recurrent structure outperforms a single recurrent neural network (RNN) or long short-term memory network (LSTM) in modeling the high-dimensional note sequences. Among all the MLMs, LSTM-RBM helps the system yield the best results on all evaluation metrics regardless of the performance of acoustic models.},

Many useful applications based on NMF, including musical source separation and polyphonic transcription, have been presented in the field of music information retrieval. The multiplicative update rules for making inference on the NMF model are quite simple and practical; however, they do not scale up well with the increasing size of the dictionary matrices. In this study, we develop efficient approaches based on randomized matrix decompositions and exemplar selection that can easily handle very large dictionary matrices that can be encountered in real applications. We apply our methods on the transcription of polyphonic piano music. The results show that by only retaining 1% of a large dictionary matrix, we still get high performance in terms of objective measures.},

abstract = {The recent advances in deep neural networks have convincingly demonstrated high capability in learning vision models on large datasets. Nevertheless, collecting expert labeled datasets especially with pixel-level annotations is an extremely expensive process. An appealing alternative is to render synthetic data (e.g., computer games) and generate ground truth automatically. However, simply applying the models learnt on synthetic images may lead to high generalization error on real images due to domain shift. In this paper, we facilitate this issue from the perspectives of both visual appearance-level and representation-level domain adaptation. The former adapts source-domain images to appear as if drawn from the "style" in the target domain and the latter attempts to learn domain-invariant representations. Specifically, we present Fully Convolutional Adaptation Networks (FCAN), a novel deep architecture for semantic segmentation which combines Appearance Adaptation Networks (AAN) and Representation Adaptation Networks (RAN). AAN learns a transformation from one domain to the other in the pixel space and RAN is optimized in an adversarial learning manner to maximally fool the domain discriminator with the learnt source and target representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the transfer from GTA5 (game videos) to Cityscapes (urban street scenes) on semantic segmentation and our proposal achieves superior results when comparing to state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation techniques. More remarkably, we obtain a new record: mIoU of 47.5% on BDDS (drive-cam videos) in an unsupervised setting.},

@article{bello2006transcription,
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to propose solutions to some problems that arise in automatic polyphonic transcription of recorded piano music. First, we propose a method that groups spectral information in the frequency-domain and uses a rule-based framework to deal with the known problems of polyphony and harmonicity. Then, we present a novel method for multipitch-estimation that uses both frequency and time-domain information. It assumes signal segments to be the linearly weighted sum of waveforms in a database of individual piano notes. We propose a solution to the problem of generating those waveforms, by using the frequency-domain approach. We show that accurate time-domain transcription can be achieved given an adequate estimation of the database. This suggests an alternative to common frequency-domain approaches that does not require any prior training on a separate database of isolated notes},

In this note we show that the requirement of absolute continuity is necessary: we describe a simple yet prototypical counterexample showing that in the more realistic case of distributions that are not absolutely continuous, unregularized GAN training is generally not convergent. Furthermore, we discuss recent regularization strategies that were proposed to stabilize GAN training. Our analysis shows that while GAN training with instance noise or gradient penalties converges, Wasserstein-GANs and Wasserstein-GANs-GP with a finite number of discriminator updates per generator update do in general not converge to the equilibrium point. We explain these results and show that both instance noise and gradient penalties constitute solutions to the problem of purely imaginary eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the gradient vector field. Based on our analysis, we also propose a simplified gradient penalty with the same effects on local convergence as more complicated penalties.},

@article{kelz2018transcribe,
abstract = {Rethinking how to model polyphonic transcription formally, we frame it as a reinforcement learning task. Such a task formulation encompasses the notion of a musical agent and an environment containing an instrument as well as the sound source to be transcribed. Within this conceptual framework, the transcription process can be described as the agent interacting with the instrument in the environment, and obtaining reward by playing along with what it hears. Choosing from a discrete set of actions - the notes to play on its instrument - the amount of reward the agent experiences depends on which notes it plays and when. This process resembles how a human musician might approach the task of transcription, and the satisfaction she achieves by closely mimicking the sound source to transcribe on her instrument. Following a discussion of the theoretical framework and the benefits of modelling the problem in this way, we focus our attention on several practical considerations and address the difficulties in training an agent to acceptable performance on a set of tasks with increasing difficulty. We demonstrate promising results in partially constrained environments.},

@article{huang2018transformer,
abstract = {Music relies heavily on self-reference to build structure and meaning. We explore the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) as a generative model for music, as self-attention has shown compelling results on tasks that require long-term structure such as Wikipedia summary generation (Liu et al, 2018). However, timing information is critical for polyphonic music, and Transformer does not explicitly model absolute or relative timing in its structure. To address this challenge, Shaw et al. (2018) introduced relative position representations to self-attention to improve machine translation. However, the formulation was not scalable to longer sequences. We propose an improved formulation which reduces the memory requirements of the relative position computation from $O(l^2d)$ to $O(ld)$, making it possible to train much longer sequences and achieve faster convergence. In experiments on symbolic music we find that relative self-attention substantially improves sample quality for unconditioned generation and is able to generate sequences of lengths longer than those from the training set. When primed with an initial sequence, the model generates continuations that develop the prime coherently and exhibit long-term structure. Relative self-attention can be instrumental in capturing richer relationships within a musical piece.},

@article{grindlay2011eigeninstruments,
abstract = {This paper presents a general probabilistic model for transcribing single-channel music recordings containing multiple polyphonic instrument sources. The system requires no prior knowledge of the instruments present in the mixture (other than the number), although it can benefit from information about instrument type if available. In contrast to many existing polyphonic transcription systems, our approach explicitly models the individual instruments and is thereby able to assign detected notes to their respective sources. We use training instruments to learn a set of linear manifolds in model parameter space which are then used during transcription to constrain the properties of models fit to the target mixture. This leads to a hierarchical mixture-of-subspaces design which makes it possible to supply the system with prior knowledge at different levels of abstraction. The proposed technique is evaluated on both recorded and synthesized mixtures containing two, three, four, and five instruments each. We compare our approach in terms of transcription with (i.e., detected pitches must be associated with the correct instrument) and without source-assignment to another multi-instrument transcription system as well as a baseline non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. For two-instrument mixtures evaluated with source-assignment, we obtain average frame-level <formula formulatype="inline"> <tex Notation="TeX">${\rm F}$</tex></formula>-measures of up to 0.52 in the completely blind transcription setting (i.e., no prior knowledge of the instruments in the mixture) and up to 0.67 if we assume knowledge of the basic instrument types. For transcription without source assignment, these numbers rise to 0.76 and 0.83, respectively.},

Within this framework, we use stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to marginalize the weights of the generator and discriminator networks. The resulting approach is straightforward and obtains good performance without any standard interventions such as feature matching, or mini-batch discrimination. By exploring an expressive posterior over the parameters of the generator, the Bayesian GAN avoids mode-collapse, produces interpretable and diverse candidate samples, and provides state-of-the-art quantitative results for semi-supervised learning on benchmarks including SVHN, CelebA, and CIFAR-10, outperforming DCGAN, Wasserstein GANs, and DCGAN ensembles.},

@inproceedings{ullrich2017seq2seq,
abstract = {Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is a fundamen-tal problem in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The challenge is to translate an audio sequence to a symbolic representation of music. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to the task by translating frames of audio [44, 46]. However, those models can by their nature not model temporal re-lations and long time dependencies. Furthermore, it is extremely labor intense to get annotations for supervised learning in this setting. We propose a model that over-comes all these problems. The convolutional sequence to sequence (Cseq2seq) model applies a CNN to learn a low dimensional representation of audio frames and a sequen-tial model to translate these learned features to a symbolic representation directly. Our approach has three advantages over other methods: (i) extracting audio frame representa-tions and learning the sequential model is jointly trained end-to-end, (ii) the recurrent model can capture temporal features in musical pieces in order to improve transcrip-tion, and (iii) our model learns from entire sequences as opposed to temporally accurately annotated onsets and off-sets for each note thus making it possible to train on large already existing corpora of music. For the purpose of test-ing our method we created our own dataset of 17K mono-phonic songs and respective MusicXML files. Initial ex-periments proof the validity of our approach.},

abstract = {Automatic music transcription is considered by many to be a key enabling technology in music signal processing. However, the performance of transcription systems is still significantly below that of a human expert, and accuracies reported in recent years seem to have reached a limit, although the field is still very active. In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. One way to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems is to tailor algorithms to specific use-cases. Semi-automatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription. Also, the wealth of musical scores and corresponding audio data now available are a rich potential source of training data, via forced alignment of audio to scores, but large scale utilisation of such data has yet to be attempted. Other promising approaches include the integration of information from multiple algorithms and different musical aspects.},

Point estimates of the parameters of partial frequencies of a musical note are modeled as realizations from a non-homogeneous Poisson process defined on the frequency axis. When several notes are combined, the processes for the individual notes combine to give a new Poisson process whose likelihood is easy to compute. This model avoids the data-association step of linking the harmonics of each note with the corresponding partials and is ideal for efficient Bayesian inference of unknown multiple fundamental frequencies in a signal.},

We also compare different neural network architectures for acoustic modeling. The proposed model computes a distribution over possible output sequences given the acoustic input signal and we present an algorithm for performing a global search for good candidate transcriptions. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated on piano music from the MAPS dataset and we observe that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing transcription methods.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new music signal processing method to extract multiple fundamental frequencies, which we call specmurt analysis. In contrast with cepstrum which is the inverse Fourier transform of log-scaled power spectrum with linear frequency, specmurt is defined as the inverse Fourier transform of linear power spectrum with log-scaled frequency. Assuming that all tones in a polyphonic sound have a common harmonic pattern, the sound spectrum can be regarded as a sum of linearly stretched common harmonic structures along frequency. In the log-frequency domain, it is formulated as the convolution of a common harmonic structure and the distribution density of the fundamental frequencies of multiple tones. The fundamental frequency distribution can be found by deconvolving the observed spectrum with the assumed common harmonic structure, where the common harmonic structure is given heuristically or quasi-optimized with an iterative algorithm. The efficiency of specmurt analysis is experimentally demonstrated through generation of a piano-roll-like display from a polyphonic music signal and automatic sound-to-MIDI conversion. Multipitch estimation accuracy is evaluated over several polyphonic music signals and compared with manually annotated MIDI data.},

@article{esling2018generative,
abstract = {Timbre spaces have been used in music perception to study the relationships between instruments based on dissimilarity ratings. However, these spaces do not generalize, need to be reconstructed for each novel example and are not continuous, preventing audio synthesis. In parallel, generative models have aimed to provide methods for synthesizing novel timbres. However, these systems do not provide an explicit control structure, nor do they provide an understanding of their inner workings and are not related to any perceptually relevant information. Here, we show that Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can alleviate these limitations by constructing generative timbre spaces. To do so, we adapt VAEs to create a generative latent space, while using perceptual ratings from timbre studies to regularize the organization of this space. The resulting space allows to analyze novel instruments, while being able to synthesize audio from any point of this space. We introduce a specific regularization allowing to directly enforce given similarity ratings onto these spaces. We compare the resulting space to existing timbre spaces and show that they provide almost similar distance relationships. We evaluate several spectral transforms and show that the Non-Stationary Gabor Transform (NSGT) provides the highest correlation to timbre spaces and the best quality of synthesis. We show that these spaces can generalize to novel instruments and can generate any path between instruments to understand their timbre relationships. As these spaces are continuous, we study how the traditional acoustic descriptors behave along the latent dimensions. We show that descriptors have an overall non-linear topology, but follow a locally smooth evolution. Based on this, we introduce a method for descriptor-based synthesis and show that we can control the descriptors of an instrument while keeping its timbre structure.},

In this paper, we show that PLSI and NMF (with the I-divergence objective function) optimize the same objective function, although PLSI and NMF are different algorithms as verified by experiments. This provides a theoretical basis for a new hybrid method that runs PLSI and NMF alternatively, each jumping out of the local minima of the other method successively, thus achieving a better final solution. Extensive experiments on five real-life datasets show relations between NMF and PLSI, and indicate that the hybrid method leads to significant improvements over NMF-only or PLSI-only methods. We also show that at first-order approximation, NMF is identical to the ??2-statistic. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {We present a Bayesian analysis method that estimates the harmonic structure of musical instruments in music signals on the basis of psychoacoustic evidence. Since the main objective of multipitch analysis is joint estimation of the fundamental frequencies and their harmonic structures, the performance of harmonic structure estimation significantly affects fundamental frequency estimation accuracy. Many methods have been proposed for estimating the harmonic structure accurately, but no method has been proposed that satisfies all these requirements: robust against initialization, optimization-free, and psychoacoustically appropriate and thus easy to develop further. Our method satisfies these requirements by explicitly incorporating Terhardt's virtual pitch theory within a Bayesian framework. It does this by automatically learning the valid weight range of the harmonic components using a MIDI synthesizer. The bounds are termed "overtone corpus." Modeling demonstrated that the proposed overtone corpus method can stably estimate the harmonic structure of 40 musical pieces for a wide variety of initial settings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Information Processing Society of Japan.},

abstract = {Given a musical audio recording, the goal of music transcription is to determine a score-like representation of the piece underlying the recording. Most current transcription methods employ variants of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which often fails to robustly model instruments producing non-stationary sounds. Using entire time-frequency patterns to represent sounds, non-negative matrix deconvolution (NMD) can capture certain types of non-stationary behavior but is only applicable if all sounds have the same length. In this paper, we present a novel method that combines the non-stationarity modeling capabilities available with NMD with the variable note lengths possible with NMF. Identifying frames in NMD patterns with states in a dynamical system, our method iteratively generates sound-object candidates separately for each pitch, which are then combined in a global optimization. We demonstrate the transcription capabilities of our method using piano pieces assuming the availability of single note recordings as training data.},

@article{emiya2010smoothness,
abstract = {A new method for the estimation of multiple concurrent pitches in piano recordings is presented. It addresses the issue of overlapping overtones by modeling the spectral envelope of the overtones of each note with a smooth autoregressive model. For the background noise, a moving-average model is used and the combination of both tends to eliminate harmonic and sub-harmonic erroneous pitch estimations. This leads to a complete generative spectral model for simultaneous piano notes, which also explicitly includes the typical deviation from exact harmonicity in a piano overtone series. The pitch set which maximizes an approximate likelihood is selected from among a restricted number of possible pitch combinations as the one. Tests have been conducted on a large homemade database called MAPS, composed of piano recordings from a real upright piano and from high-quality samples.},

This study proposes and compares a variety of alternative objective functions for training deep clustering networks. In addition, whereas the orig- inal deep clustering work relied on k-means clustering for test-time inference, here we investigate inference methods that are matched to the training objective. Furthermore, we explore the use of an im- proved chimera network architecture for speech separation, which combines deep clustering with mask-inference networks in a multi- objective training scheme. The deep clustering loss acts as a regular- izer while training the end-to-end mask inference network for best separation. With further iterative phase reconstruction, our best pro- posed method achieves a state-of-the-art 11.5 dB signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) result on the publicly available wsj0-2mix dataset, with a much simpler architecture than the previous best approach.},

@article{cogliati2017lateral,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. This letter extends our prior work on context-dependent piano transcription to estimate the length of the notes in addition to their pitch and onset. This approach employs convolutional sparse coding along with lateral inhibition constraints to approximate a musical signal as the sum of piano note waveforms (dictionary elements) convolved with their temporal activations. The waveforms are pre-recorded for the specific piano to be transcribed in the specific environment. A dictionary containing multiple waveforms per pitch is generated by truncating a long waveform for each pitch to different lengths. During transcription, the dictionary elements are fixed and their temporal activations are estimated and postprocessed to obtain the pitch, onset, and note length estimation. A sparsity penalty promotes globally sparse activations of the dictionary elements, and a lateral inhibition term penalizes concurrent activations of different waveforms corresponding to the same pitch within a temporal neighborhood, to achieve note length estimation. Experiments on the MIDI aligned piano sounds dataset show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art music transcription method trained in the same context-dependent setting in transcription accuracy.},

The proposed algorithm is quite different from others in the literature both in its purpose and approach. It is destined not for continuous multiple f0recognition but rather for projection of the ongoing spectrum to learned pitch templates. The decomposition algorithm on the otherhand, does not compromise signal processing models for pitches and consists of an algorithm for efficient decomposition of a spectrum using known pitch structures and based on sparse non-negative constraints. After introducing the algorithm along with evaluations,a real-time implementation of the algorithm is provided for free download on the MaxMSP realtime programming environment.},

@article{caetano2013musical,
abstract = {Sound morphing is a transformation that gradually blurs the distinction between the source and target sounds. For musical instrument sounds, the morph must operate across timbre dimensions to create the auditory illusion of hybridmusical instruments. The ultimate goal of sound morphing is to perform perceptually linear transitions, which requires an appropriate model to represent the sounds being morphed and an interpolation function to obtain intermediate sounds. Typically, morphing techniques directly interpolate the parameters of the sound model without considering the perceptual impact or evaluating the results. Perceptual evaluations are cumbersome and not always conclusive. In this work, we seek parameters of a sound model that favor linear variation of perceptually motivated temporal and spectral features used to guide the morph towards more perceptually linear results. The requirement of linear variation of feature values gives rise to objective evaluation criteria for sound morphing. We investigate several spectral envelope morphing techniques to determine which spectral representation renders the most linear transformation in the spectral shape feature domain. We found that interpolation of line spectral frequencies gives the most linear spectral envelope morphs. Analogously, we study temporal envelope morphing techniques and we concluded that interpolation of cepstral coefficients results in the most linear temporal envelope morph.},

abstract = {It is only very recently that systems have been de- veloped that transcribe polyphonic music with more than two voices in even limited generality. Two of these systems [Kashino et al.1995, Martin 1996] have been built within a blackboard framework, integrating front ends based on sinusoidal analysis with musical knowledge. These and other systems to date rely on instrument models for detecting octaves. Recent re- sults have shown that an autocorrelation-based front end may make bottom-up detection of octaves pos- sible, thereby improving system performance as well as reducing the distance between transcription models and human audition. This report outlines the black- board approach to automatic transcription and presents a new system based on the log-lag correlogram of [El- lis 1996]. Preliminary results are presented, outlining the bottom-up detection of octaves and transcription of simple polyphonic music.},

abstract = {Given a musical audio recording, the goal of automatic music transcription is to determine a score-like representation of the piece underlying the recording. Despite significant interest within the research community, several studies have reported on a 'glass ceiling' effect, an apparent limit on the transcription accuracy that current methods seem incapable of overcoming. In this paper, we explore how much this effect can be mitigated by focusing on a specific instrument class and making use of additional information on the recording conditions available in studio or home recording scenarios. In particular, exploiting the availability of single note recordings for the instrument in use we develop a novel signal model employing variable-length spectro-temporal patterns as its central building blocks - tailored for pitched percussive instruments such as the piano. Temporal dependencies between spectral templates are modeled, resembling characteristics of factorial scaled hidden Markov models (FS-HMM) and other methods combining Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with Markov processes. In contrast to FS-HMMs, our parameter estimation is developed in a global, relaxed form within the extensible alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, which enables the systematic combination of basic regularizers propagating sparsity and local stationarity in note activity with more complex regularizers imposing temporal semantics. The proposed method achieves an f-measure of 93-95% for note onsets on pieces recorded on a Yamaha Disklavier (MAPS DB).},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the Bayesian analysis of musical signals. The ultimate \naim is to use Bayesian hierarchical structures in order to infer quantities at the highest \nlevel, including such quantities as musical pitch, dynamics, timbre, instrument identity, \netc. Analysis of real musical signals is complicated by many things, including the presence \nof transient sounds, noises and the complex structure of musical pitches in the frequency \ndomain. The problem is truly Bayesian in that there is a wealth of (often subjective) prior \nknwowledge about how musical signals are constructed, which can be exploited in order \nto achieve more accurate inference about the musical structure. Here we propose devel- \nopments to an earlier Bayesian model which describes each component `note' at a given \ntime in terms of a fundamental frequency, partials (`harmonics'), and amplitude. This \nbasic model is modified for greater realism to include non-white residuals, time-varying \namplitudes and partials `detuned' from the natural linear relationship. The unknown pa- \nrameters of the new model are simulated using a variable dimension MCMC algorithm, \nleading to a highly sophisticated analysis tool. We discuss how the models and algorithms \ncan be applied for feature extraction, polyphonic music transcription, source separation \nand restoration of musical sources. \n},

@article{argenti2011bispectral,
abstract = {In the area of music information retrieval (MIR), automatic music transcription is considered one of the most challenging tasks, for which many different techniques have been proposed. This paper presents a new method for polyphonic music transcription: a system that aims at estimating pitch, onset times, durations, and intensity of concurrent sounds in audio recordings, played by one or more instruments. Pitch estimation is carried out by means of a front-end that jointly uses a constant-Q and a bispectral analysis of the input audio signal; subsequently, the processed signal is correlated with a fixed 2-D harmonic pattern. Onsets and durations detection procedures are based on the combination of the constant-Q bispectral analysis with information from the signal spectrogram. The detection process is agnostic and it does not need to take into account musicological and instrumental models or other a priori knowledge. The system has been validated against the standard Real-World Computing (RWC)&#x2014;Classical Audio Database. The proposed method has demonstrated good performances in the multiple <formula formulatype="inline"><tex Notation="TeX">$F0$</tex> </formula> tracking task, especially for piano-only automatic transcription at MIREX 2009.},

Unlike previous approaches, the proposed model is able to represent not only the harmonic partials but also the inharmonic attack of each note. We derive an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model and illustrate the higher performance of the proposed algorithm than NMF algorithm [9] and HTC algorithm [10] for the task of multipitch estimation over synthetic and real-world data.},

@article{dong2018binary,
abstract = {It has been shown recently that deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) can learn to generate music in the form of piano-rolls, which represent music by binary-valued time-pitch matrices. However, existing models can only generate real-valued piano-rolls and require further post-processing, such as hard thresholding (HT) or Bernoulli sampling (BS), to obtain the final binary-valued results. In this paper, we study whether we can have a convolutional GAN model that directly creates binary-valued piano-rolls by using binary neurons. Specifically, we propose to append to the generator an additional refiner network, which uses binary neurons at the output layer. The whole network is trained in two stages. Firstly, the generator and the discriminator are pretrained. Then, the refiner network is trained along with the discriminator to learn to binarize the real-valued piano-rolls the pretrained generator creates. Experimental results show that using binary neurons instead of HT or BS indeed leads to better results in a number of objective measures. Moreover, deterministic binary neurons perform better than stochastic ones in both objective measures and a subjective test. The source code, training data and audio examples of the generated results can be found at https://salu133445.github.io/bmusegan/ .},

We propose a novel framework, namely 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN), which generates 3D objects from a probabilistic space by leveraging recent advances in volumetric convolutional networks and generative adversarial nets. The benefits of our model are three-fold: first, the use of an adversarial criterion, instead of traditional heuristic criteria, enables the generator to capture object structure implicitly and to synthesize high-quality 3D objects; second, the generator establishes a mapping from a low-dimensional probabilistic space to the space of 3D objects, so that we can sample objects without a reference image or CAD models, and explore the 3D object manifold; third, the adversarial discriminator provides a powerful 3D shape descriptor which, learned without supervision, has wide applications in 3D object recognition. Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality 3D objects, and our unsupervisedly learned features achieve impressive performance on 3D object recognition, comparable with those of supervised learning methods.},

The method transcribes notes played with pitched musical instru-ments. Percussive sounds, such as drums, may be present but they are not transcribed. Musical notations (i.e., MIDI files) are produced from acoustic stereo input files using probabilistic note event modeling. Note events are described with a hidden Markov model (HMM). The model uses three acoustic features extracted with a multiple fundamental frequency (F0) estimator to calculate the likelihoods of different notes and performs temporal segmen-tation of notes. The transitions between notes are controlled with a musicological model involving musical key estimation and bigram models. The final transcription is obtained by searching for several paths through the note models. Evaluation was carried out with a realistic music database. Using strict evaluation criteria, 39% of all the notes were found (recall) and 41% of the transcribed notes were correct (precision). Taken the complexity of the considered transcription task, the results are encouraging.},

abstract = {Research on musical timbre typically seeks representations of the perceptual structure inherent in a set of sounds that have implications for expressive control over the sounds in composition and performance. With digital analysis-based sound synthesis and with experiments on tone quality perception, we can obtain representations of sounds that suggest ways to provide low-dimensional control over their perceptually important properties. In this paper, we will describe a system for taking subjective measures of perceptual contrast between sound objects and using this data as input to some computer programs. The computer programs use multidimensional scaling algorithms to generate geometric representations from the input data. In the timbral spaces that result from the scaling programs, the various tones can be represented as points and a good statistical relationship can be sought between the distances in the space and the contrast judgments between the corresponding tones. The spatial representation is given a psychoacoustical interpretation by relating its dimensions to the acoustical properties of the tones. Controls are then applied directly to these properties in synthesis. The control schemes to be described are for additive synthesis and allow for the manipulation of the evolving spectral energy distribution and various temporal features of the tones. Tests of the control schemes have been carried out in musical contexts. Particular emphasis will be given here to the construction of melodic lines in which the timbre is manipulated on a note-to-note basis. Implications for the design of human control interfaces and of software for real-time digital sound synthesizers will be discussed. Musical},

This paper introduces Probability Density Distillation, a new method for training a parallel feed-forward network from a trained WaveNet with no significant difference in quality.

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been shown to be able to sample impressively realistic images. GAN training consists of a saddle point optimization problem that can be thought of as an adversarial game between a generator which produces the images, and a discriminator, which judges if the images are real. Both the generator and the discriminator are commonly parametrized as deep convolutional neural networks. The goal of this paper is to disentangle the contribution of the optimization procedure and the network parametrization to the success of GANs. To this end we introduce and study Generative Latent Optimization (GLO), a framework to train a generator without the need to learn a discriminator, thus avoiding challenging adversarial optimization problems. We show experimentally that GLO enjoys many of the desirable properties of GANs: learning from large data, synthesizing visually-appealing samples, interpolating meaningfully between samples, and performing linear arithmetic with noise vectors.},

abstract = {We present work towards a computer system for the automatic transcription of piano perfor- mances. The system takes audio files containing polyphonic piano music as input, and produces MIDI output, representing the pitch, timing and volume of the musical notes. The aim of this work is not to reduce the performance data to common music notation, but to extract the per- formance parameters for a quantitative study of musical expression in piano performance. Stan- dard signal processing techniques based on the short time Fourier transform are used to create a time-frequency representation of the signal, and adaptive peak-picking and pattern matching al- gorithms are employed to find themusical notes. In order to perform large scale testing, the test process is automated by synthesizing audio data fromMIDI files using high quality sofware syn- thesis, and comparing results with the original MIDI data. The test data used is Mozart piano sonatas performed by a concert pianist. 1 INTRODUCTION This paper addresses the problem of ext},

abstract = {This paper deals with the computational analysis of musical audio from recorded audio waveforms. This general problem includes, as subtasks, music transcription, extraction of musical pitch, dynamics, timbre, instrument identity, and source separation. Analysis of real musical signals is a highly ill-posed task which is made complicated by the presence of transient sounds, background interference, or the complex structure of musical pitches in the time-frequency domain. This paper focuses on models and algorithms for computer transcription of multiple musical pitches in audio, elaborated from previous work by two of the authors. The audio data are supposedly presegmented into fixed pitch regimes such as individual chords. The models presented apply to pitched (tonal) music and are formulated via a Gabor representation of nonstationary signals. A Bayesian probabilistic structure is employed for representation of prior information about the parameters of the notes. This paper introduces a numerical Bayesian inference strategy for estimation of the pitches and other parameters of the waveform. The improved algorithm is much quicker and makes the approach feasible in realistic situations. Results are presented for estimation of a known number of notes present in randomly generated note clusters from a real musical instrument database.},

abstract = {Voice cloning is a highly desired feature for personalized speech interfaces. Neural network based speech synthesis has been shown to gen-erate high quality speech for a large number of speakers. In this paper, we introduce a neural voice cloning system that takes a few audio sam-ples as input. We study two approaches: speaker adaptation and speaker encoding. Speaker adapta-tion is based on fine-tuning a multi-speaker gener-ative model with a few cloning samples. Speaker encoding is based on training a separate model to directly infer a new speaker embedding from cloning audios and to be used with a multi-speaker generative model. In terms of naturalness of the speech and its similarity to original speaker, both approaches can achieve good performance, even with very few cloning audios. 1 While speaker adaptation can achieve better naturalness and simi-larity, the cloning time or required memory for the speaker encoding approach is significantly less, making it favorable for low-resource deployment.},

@article{reis2012genetic,
abstract = {This paper presents a new method for multiple fundamental frequency (F0) estimation on piano recordings. We propose a framework based on a genetic algorithm in order to analyze the overlapping overtones and search for the most likely F0 combination. The search process is aided by adaptive spectral envelope modeling and dynamic noise level estimation: while the noise is dynamically estimated, the spectral envelope of previously recorded piano samples (internal database) is adapted in order to best match the piano played on the input signals and aid the search process for the most likely combination of F0s. For comparison, several state-of-the-art algorithms were run across various musical pieces played by different pianos and then compared using three different metrics. The proposed algorithm ranked first place on Hybrid Decay/Sustain Score metric, which has better correlation with the human hearing perception and ranked second place on both onset-only and onset-offset metrics. A previous genetic algorithm approach is also included in the comparison to show how the proposed system brings significant improvements on both quality of the results and computing time.},

DrummerNet does not require any ground-truth transcription and, with the data-scalability of deep neural networks, learns from a large unlabeled dataset. In DrummerNet, the target drum signal is first passed to a (trainable) transcriber, then reconstructed in a (fixed) synthesizer according to the transcription estimate. By training the system to minimize the distance between the input and the output audio signals, the transcriber learns to transcribe without ground truth transcription. Our experiment shows that DrummerNet performs favorably compared to many other recent drum transcription systems, both supervised and unsupervised.},

This objective can be interpreted as training a generator to produce samples that lie on the decision boundary of the current discriminator in training at each update, and we call a GAN trained using this algorithm a boundary-seeking GAN (BGAN). This approach can be used to train a generator with discrete output when the generator outputs a parametric conditional distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with discrete image and character-based natural language generation. Finally, we notice that the proposed boundary-seeking algorithm works even with continuous variables, and demonstrate its effectiveness with various natural image benchmarks.},

The proposed method is based on non-negative matrix factorisation, with the following three refinements: (1) introduction of attack and harmonic decay components; (2) use of a spike-shaped note activation that is shared by these components; (3) modelling the harmonic decay with an exponential function. Transcription is performed in a supervised way, with the training and test datasets produced by the same piano. First we train parameters for the attack and decay components on isolated notes, then update only the note activations for transcription. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 82% on note-wise and 79% on frame-wise F-measures on the 'ENSTDkCl' subset of the MAPS database, outper-forming the current published state of the art.},

Our system requires no prior knowledge of the instruments in the mixture, although it can benefit from this information if available. In contrast to many existing polyphonic transcription systems, our approach explicitly models the individual instruments and is thereby able to assign detected notes to their respective sources. We use a set of training instruments to learn a model space which is then used during transcription to constrain the properties of models fit to the target mixture. In addition, we encourage model sparsity using a simple approach related to tempering. We evaluate our method on both recorded and synthesized two-instrument mixtures, obtaining average framelevel F-measures of up to 0.60 for synthesized audio and 0.53 for recorded audio. If knowledge of the instrument types in the mixture is available, we can increase these measures to 0.68 and 0.58, respectively, by initializing the model with parameters from similar instruments.},

abstract = {Efficient audio synthesis is an inherently difficult machine learning task, as human perception is sensitive to both global structure and fine-scale waveform coherence. Autoregressive models, such as WaveNet, model local structure at the expense of global latent structure and slow iterative sampling, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have global latent conditioning and efficient parallel sampling, but struggle to generate locally-coherent audio waveforms. Herein, we demonstrate that GANs can in fact generate high-fidelity and locally-coherent audio by modeling log magnitudes and instantaneous frequencies with sufficient frequency resolution in the spectral domain. Through extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset, we demonstrate that GANs are able to outperform strong WaveNet baselines on automated and human evaluation metrics, and efficiently generate audio several orders of magnitude faster than their autoregressive counterparts.},

abstract = {The analysis of musical signals to extract audio descriptors that can potentially characterize their timbre has been disparate and often too focused on a particular small set of sounds. The Timbre Toolbox provides a comprehensive set of descriptors that can be useful in perceptual research, as well as in music information retrieval and machine-learning approaches to content-based retrieval in large sound databases. Sound events are first analyzed in terms of various input representations (short-term Fourier transform, harmonic sinusoidal components, an auditory model based on the equivalent rectangular bandwidth concept, the energy envelope). A large number of audio descriptors are then derived from each of these representations to capture temporal, spectral, spectrotemporal, and energetic properties of the sound events. Some descriptors are global, providing a single value for the whole sound event, whereas others are time-varying. Robust descriptive statistics are used to characterize the time-varying descriptors. To examine the information redundancy across audio descriptors, correlational analysis followed by hierarchical clustering is performed. This analysis suggests ten classes of relatively independent audio descriptors, showing that the Timbre Toolbox is a multidimensional instrument for the measurement of the acoustical structure of complex sound signals. {\textcopyright} 2011 Acoustical Society of America.},

It is also shown that an approximate pure equilibrium exists in the discriminator/generator game for a special class of generators with natural training objectives when generator capacity and training set sizes are moderate. This existence of equilibrium inspires MIX+GAN protocol, which can be combined with any existing GAN training, and empirically shown to improve some of them.},

abstract = {A method for automatic transcription of polyphonic music is proposed in this work that models the temporal evolution of musical tones. The model extends the shift-invariant probabilistic latent component analysis method by supporting the use of spectral templates that correspond to sound states such as attack, sustain, and decay. The order of these templates is controlled using hidden Markov model-based temporal constraints. In addition, the model can exploit multiple templates per pitch and instrument source. The shift-invariant aspect of the model makes it suitable for music signals that exhibit frequency modulations or tuning changes. Pitch-wise hidden Markov models are also utilized in a postprocessing step for note tracking. For training, sound state templates were extracted for various orchestral instruments using isolated note samples. The proposed transcription system was tested on multiple-instrument recordings from various datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to a non-temporally constrained model and also outperforms various state-of-the-art transcription systems for the same experiment.},

When ap- plied to recordings of polyphonic piano music, the indi- vidual notes are identified as salient features, and hence each short-term spectrum is decomposed into a sum of note spectra; the resulting encoding can be used as a ba- sis for polyphonic transcription. The system is based on a probabilistic model equivalent to a form of noisy inde- pendent component analysis (ICA) or sparse coding with non-negativity constraints. We introduce a novel mod- ification to this model that recognises that a short-term Fourier spectrum can be thought of as a noisy realisation of the power spectral density of an underlying Gaussian process, where the noise is essentially multiplicative and non-Gaussian. Results are presented for an analysis of a live recording of polyphonic piano music.},

Fisher GAN defines a critic with a data dependent constraint on its second order moments. We show in this paper that Fisher GAN allows for stable and time efficient training that does not compromise the capacity of the critic, and does not need data independent constraints such as weight clipping. We analyze our Fisher IPM theoretically and provide an algorithm based on Augmented Lagrangian for Fisher GAN. We validate our claims on both image sample generation and semi-supervised classification using Fisher GAN.},

@inproceedings{dong2018musegan,
abstract = {Generating music has a few notable differences from generating images and videos. First, music is an art of time, necessitating a temporal model. Second, music is usually composed of multiple instruments/tracks with their own temporal dynamics, but collectively they unfold over time interdependently. Lastly, musical notes are often grouped into chords, arpeggios or melodies in polyphonic music, and thereby introducing a chronological ordering of notes is not naturally suitable. In this paper, we propose three models for symbolic multi-track music generation under the framework of generative adversarial networks (GANs). The three models, which differ in the underlying assumptions and accordingly the network architectures, are referred to as the jamming model, the composer model and the hybrid model. We trained the proposed models on a dataset of over one hundred thousand bars of rock music and applied them to generate piano-rolls of five tracks: bass, drums, guitar, piano and strings. A few intra-track and inter-track objective metrics are also proposed to evaluate the generative results, in addition to a subjective user study. We show that our models can generate coherent music of four bars right from scratch (i.e. without human inputs). We also extend our models to human-AI cooperative music generation: given a specific track composed by human, we can generate four additional tracks to accompany it. All code, the dataset and the rendered audio samples are available at https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/ .},

abstract = {This paper presents theoretical and experimental results about constrained non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in a Bayesian framework. A model of superimposed Gaussian components including harmonicity is proposed, while temporal continuity is enforced through an inverse-Gamma Markov chain prior. We then exhibit a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm to estimate the parameters. Computational time is reduced by initializing the system with an original variant of multiplicative harmonic NMF, which is described as well. The algorithm is then applied to perform polyphonic piano music transcription. It is compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, especially NMF-based. Convergence issues are also discussed on a theoretical and experimental point of view. Bayesian NMF with harmonicity and temporal continuity constraints is shown to outperform other standard NMF-based transcription systems, providing a meaningful mid-level representation of the data. However, temporal smoothness has its drawbacks, as far as transients are concerned in particular, and can be detrimental to transcription performance when it is the only constraint used. Possible improvements of the temporal prior are discussed.},

We systematically compare different popular input representations for transcription systems to determine the ones most suitable for use with neural networks. Exploiting recent advances in training techniques and new regularizers, and taking into account hyper-parameter tuning, we show that it is possible, by simple bottom-up frame-wise processing, to obtain a piano transcriber that outperforms the current published state of the art on the publicly available MAPS dataset -- without any complex post-processing steps. Thus, we propose this simple approach as a new baseline for this dataset, for future transcription research to build on and improve.},

abstract = {Conditional variants of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), known as cGANs, are generative models that can produce data samples ($x$) conditioned on both latent variables ($z$) and known auxiliary information ($c$). Another GAN variant, Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN) is a recently developed framework for learning the inverse mapping from $x$ to $z$ through an encoder trained simultaneously with the generator and the discriminator of an unconditional GAN. We propose the Bidirectional Conditional GAN (BCGAN), which combines cGANs and BiGANs into a single framework with an encoder that learns inverse mappings from $x$ to both $z$ and $c$, trained simultaneously with the conditional generator and discriminator in an end-to-end setting. We present crucial techniques for training BCGANs, which incorporate an extrinsic factor loss along with an associated dynamically-tuned importance weight. As compared to other encoder-based GANs, BCGANs not only encode $c$ more accurately but also utilize $z$ and $c$ more effectively and in a more disentangled way to generate data samples.},

A statistical tone model of the power spectrogram, called an integrated model, is defined and source separation and instrument identification are carried out on the basis of Bayesian inference. Since, the parameter distributions of the integrated model depend on each instrument, the instrument name is identified by selecting the one that has the maximum relative instrument weight. Experimental results showed correct instrument identification enables precise source separation even when many overtones overlap.},

abstract = {We propose an end-to-end approach for modeling polyphonic music with a novel graphical representation, based on music theory, in a deep neural network. Despite the success of deep learning in various applications, it remains a challenge to incorporate existing domain knowledge in a network without affecting its training routines. In this paper we present a novel approach for predictive music modeling and music generation that incorporates domain knowledge in its representation. In this work, music is transformed into a 2D representation, inspired by tonnetz from music theory, which graphically encodes musical relationships between pitches. This representation is incorporated in a deep network structure consisting of multilayered convolutional neural networks (CNN, for learning an efficient abstract encoding of the representation) and recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory cells (LSTM, for capturing temporal dependencies in music sequences). We empirically evaluate the nature and the effectiveness of the network by using a dataset of classical music from various composers. We investigate the effect of parameters including the number of convolution feature maps, pooling strategies, and three configurations of the network: LSTM without CNN, LSTM with CNN (pre-trained vs. not pre-trained). Visualizations of the feature maps and filters in the CNN are explored, and a comparison is made between the proposed tonnetz-inspired representation and pianoroll, a commonly used representation of music in computational systems. Experimental results show that the tonnetz representation produces musical sequences that are more tonally stable and contain more repeated patterns than sequences generated by pianoroll-based models, a finding that is directly useful for tackling current challenges in music and AI such as smart music generation.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

The idea is to extend the sparse NMF framework by incorporating pitch information present in time-aligned musical scores in order to extract features that enforce the separability between pitch labels. We introduce two discriminative criteria that maximize inter-class scatter and quantify the predictive potential of a given decomposition using logistic regressors. Those criteria are applied to both the latent variable and the deterministic autoencoder views of NMF, and we devise efficient update rules for each. We evaluate our method on three polyphonic datasets of piano recordings and orchestral instrument mixes. Both models greatly enhance the quality of the basis spectra learned by NMF and the accuracy of multiple pitch estimation.},

abstract = {In the early years of music information retrieval (MIR), research problems were often centered around conceptually simple tasks, and methods were evaluated on small, idealized data sets. A canonical example of this is genre recognition-i.e., Which one of n genres describes this song?-which was often evaluated on the GTZAN data set (1,000 musical excerpts balanced across ten genres) [1]. As task definitions were simple, so too were signal analysis pipelines, which often derived from methods for speech processing and recognition and typically consisted of simple methods for feature extraction, statistical modeling, and evaluation. When describing a research system, the expected level of detail was superficial: it was sufficient to state, e.g., the number of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients used, the statistical model (e.g., a Gaussian mixture model), the choice of data set, and the evaluation criteria, without stating the underlying software dependencies or implementation details. Because of an increased abundance of methods, the proliferation of software toolkits, the explosion of machine learning, and a focus shift toward more realistic problem settings, modern research systems are substantially more complex than their predecessors. Modern MIR researchers must pay careful attention to detail when processing metadata, implementing evaluation criteria, and disseminating results. {\textcopyright} 1991-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is an important task in music information retrieval. Prior work has focused on multiple fundamental frequency estimation (multi-pitch detection), the conversion of an audio signal into a time-frequency representation such as a MIDI file. It is less common to annotate this output with musical features such as voicing information, metrical structure, and harmonic information, though these are important aspects of a complete transcription. Evaluation of these features is most often performed separately and independent of multi-pitch detection; however, these features are non-independent. We therefore introduce M V 2H, a quantitative, automatic, joint evaluation metric based on musicological principles, and show its effectiveness through the use of specific examples. The metric is modularised in such a way that it can still be used with partially performed annotation-for example, when the transcription process has been applied to some transduced format such as MIDI (which may itself be the result of multi-pitch detection). The code for the evaluation metric described here is available at https://www.github.com/apmcleod/MV2H.},

abstract = {Generative moment matching network (GMMN) is a deep generative model that differs from Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by replacing the discriminator in GAN with a two-sample test based on kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Although some theoretical guarantees of MMD have been studied, the empirical performance of GMMN is still not as competitive as that of GAN on challenging and large benchmark datasets. The computational efficiency of GMMN is also less desirable in comparison with GAN, partially due to its requirement for a rather large batch size during the training. In this paper, we propose to improve both the model expressiveness of GMMN and its computational efficiency by introducing adversarial kernel learning techniques, as the replacement of a fixed Gaussian kernel in the original GMMN. The new approach combines the key ideas in both GMMN and GAN, hence we name it MMD GAN. The new distance measure in MMD GAN is a meaningful loss that enjoys the advantage of weak topology and can be optimized via gradient descent with relatively small batch sizes. In our evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR- 10, CelebA and LSUN, the performance of MMD-GAN significantly outperforms GMMN, and is competitive with other representative GAN works.},

The beta-divergence is a family of cost functions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito divergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1) using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM. Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).},

@inproceedings{luo2017deepclustering,
abstract = {Deep clustering is the first method to handle general audio separation scenarios with multiple sources of the same type and an arbitrary number of sources, performing impressively in speaker-independent speech separation tasks. However, little is known about its effectiveness in other challenging situations such as music source separation. Contrary to conventional networks that directly estimate the source signals, deep clustering generates an embedding for each time-frequency bin, and separates sources by clustering the bins in the embedding space. We show that deep clustering outperforms conventional networks on a singing voice separation task, in both matched and mismatched conditions, even though conventional networks have the advantage of end-to-end training for best signal approximation, presumably because its more flexible objective engenders better regularization. Since the strengths of deep clustering and conventional network architectures appear complementary, we explore combining them in a single hybrid network trained via an approach akin to multi-task learning. Remarkably, the combination significantly outperforms either of its components.},

@article{smaragdis2009relative,
abstract = {Perceived-pitch tracking of potentially aperiodic sounds, as well as pitch tracking of multiple simultaneous sources, is shown to be feasible using a probabilistic methodology. The use of a shift-invariant representation in the constant-Q domain allows the modeling of perceived pitch changes as vertical shifts of spectra. This enables the tracking of these changes in sounds with an arbitrary spectral profile, even those where pitch would be an ill-defined quantity. It is further possible to extend this approach to a mixture model, which allows simultaneous tracking of varying mixed sounds. Demonstrations on real recordings highlight the robustness of such a model under various adverse conditions, and also show some of its unique conceptual differences when compared to traditional pitch tracking approaches.},
